                How Bestseller Lists Actually Work - And How To Get On Them
        </h1>

            <p>
                One of the most common questions we get at my publishing company, Book In A Box, is this -- "How do I get my book on a bestseller list?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Our answer -- you probably don't want to be on a bestseller list, especially if you're an entrepreneur. We encourage our authors not to chase bestseller lists, but instead focus on their business goals for their book. This confuses them initially, but once we explain the process and tradeoffs to them, the overwhelming majority discard the bestseller dream and focus more on the business goals that are far more impactful to them.
                
                This guide covers everything about bestseller lists -- how they work, why they're not what they seem, how they lie, why chasing them is a losing proposition, what to focus on instead, and ultimately, if you insist, how to set yourself up so your book can get on them.
            </p> 
            <p>   
                Why every bestseller list is always a lie.
                Simply put -- every bestseller list is a lie because no bestseller list measures the best selling books. Let me repeat that, so you can grasp the gravity of what it means. No bestseller list measures the actual best selling books.
                
                Every single bestseller list either measures a limited number of sales in a few places, or far worse, it's a curated list and a small group of people are deciding what to put on their list. And they're picking books based on what they think are important books, not based on what is actually selling.
            </p>
             <p>   
                I am not exaggerating one bit. When questioned about the practice of deciding what books are appropriate to get bestseller status, an old school newspaper editor said they did not want to promote books that were, “sewer-written by dirty-fingered authors for dirty-minded readers.” Yes, that’s a real quote.
                
                You know what authors he was talking about? Henry Miller and Harold Robbins, now widely considered titans of modern literature. But that attitude is still prevalent today, and still infects how most editors think about books.
                
                The most important bestseller list is The New York Times bestseller list, and they are the worst culprit at this curated elitism. They readily admit that their list is only reflective of books that are selling at a certain number of bookstores and online retailers around the country -- but not an actual bestseller list. You know why they have to admit this publicly? They were sued about it.
            </p> 
            <p>   
                For most of the 20th century, they pretended to use a scientific method to count book sales and claimed their list was authoritative and accurate. And then William Blatty wrote a novel called The Exorcist -- which has sold 10 million copies and is a famous movie. It sold more than enough copies to be high on the bestseller list for a long time, but initially, it did not appear. He rightly claimed that The New York Times was intentionally excluding it for editorial reasons -- the book was considered very controversial at the time -- and claimed that their decision was costing him millions of dollars in sales.
                
                He lost the case. Why? Because The New York Times defense was that “the list did not purport to be an objective compilation of information but instead was an editorial product.” They won the case in multiple rulings all the way up to the Supreme Court, based on the argument that the list is not supposed to accurate, but reflects their judgment.
            </p>
            <p>    
                It is a valid legal argument, but it also means The New York Times admitted their bestseller list is just a popularity contest, and they select who they will and won't put in the "cool kids" club. It's like high school all over again.
